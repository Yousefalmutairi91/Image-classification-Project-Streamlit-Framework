#### Project Overview:
Since we have worked on the Convolutional Neural Networks assignments (image classification in particular) during this semester, I have decided to move forward of doing my project on the same CNN model but with a different dataset. The dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle website. In addition and after classified all the images, I worked on the Streamlit framework for building a web-app for my saved model to predict the uploaded images.
